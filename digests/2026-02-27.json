    "editor_note": "Fellow Humans, Nvidia just reported the quarter of its life and the market sold it off 5% — which tells you everything you need to know about where we are in the AI trade. Between a lukewarm reception for the most important chip company on earth, Bitcoin unwinding quietly under the cover of conspiracy theories, and mortgage rates finally cracking below 6% into a housing market that still can't get out of its own way, today's tape is a study in expectations that have simply gotten too heavy to carry.",

        "body": "Nvidia beat on revenue, profit, and guidance — and investors still sold it down 5%, dragging the Nasdaq 1.3% lower. The issue isn't the numbers; it's what wasn't said: the forward guidance excludes potential China revenue, and management offered little on when the AI capex supercycle actually translates into returns for enterprise customers. The S&P 500 dropped 0.6% while the Dow scraped flat, underscoring a market increasingly willing to punish ambiguity at peak multiples.",

The roughly 45% peak-to-trough drawdown shows the hallmarks of forced liquidation and margin cascade rather than coordinated manipulation — sharp moves, heavy volume near the lows, and a prior distribution phase visible well before February's acceleration. Selling pressure appears to be easing, though the structural damage to leveraged positioning is done.",

The 10-year Treasury yield sits at 4.02%, providing the gravitational pull.

The Supreme Court struck down Trump's broader tariff authority on February 20 but left the metals duties intact, which now appear to be actively reshaping industrial supply chains. Construction starts later this year; production is expected by end of decade.",

The bill would narrow the law's scope to entities with actual custody of user funds, explicitly carving out open-source developers. It arrives as Congress works through broader digital asset market structure legislation, and the stakes are high: Storm was convicted in August 2025, Samourai's leadership entered guilty pleas by November.",
