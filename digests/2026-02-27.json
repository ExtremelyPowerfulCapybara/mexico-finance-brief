Supply chains are repricing in real time, Canada's opposition is publicly warning against a Beijing pivot, and somewhere a speculative fiction blog post is still being blamed for a $200 billion market drawdown. It's that kind of week.",

Trump responded immediately with a blanket 10% Section 122 surcharge — effective February 24 — and the White House signaled plans to raise it to 15%.

Poilievre called Carney's overture a declaration of 'permanent rupture' with Canada's largest trading partner in favor of 'a regime the prime minister said a year ago was the biggest threat to Canada.' The speech is his most detailed statement yet on trade strategy, delivered as polls show Canadians currently trust the Liberals more to manage Trump.",

The scenario described an AI-saturated economy where companies fire white-collar workers, reinvest in AI, improve AI further, and then repeat until the labor market collapses. Citrini's thesis — that narratives drive markets more than any other factor — proved itself rather efficiently.",

Rates remain well above the 2020-2021 lows but are increasingly actionable for buyers who have been sitting on the sidelines.",
