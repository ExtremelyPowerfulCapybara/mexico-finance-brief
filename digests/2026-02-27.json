    "editor_note": "Fellow Humans, Nvidia just posted a quarter that would have triggered a ticker-tape parade in any prior bull market, and the market's response was to sell the stock 5%. That tells you everything about where sentiment sits right now: expectations have outrun reality, AI capex narratives are fraying at the edges, and investors are searching for the exit before the music stops. Meanwhile, mortgage rates quietly slipped below 6% for the first time since 2022 — a data point that deserves more attention than it's getting.",

        "body": "Nvidia beat on revenue, profit, and forward guidance, and still lost 5% on the session — the Nasdaq fell 1.3% and the S&P 500 dropped 0.6% in sympathy. Investors flagged a lack of clarity on China revenue and growing anxiety over whether AI infrastructure spending is approaching a plateau. The selloff reinforces an emerging 'AI scare trade': the question is no longer whether the buildout is real, but who actually profits when it matures.",

The 10-year Treasury yield sat at 4.02% at midday Thursday, continuing its gradual descent. The timing matters: the rate break arrives just as the spring homebuying season opens, though with nearly 69% of existing mortgages locked below 5%, the lock-in effect remains a structural ceiling on inventory.",

The roughly 45% peak-to-trough drawdown fits historical mid-cycle reset patterns. Selling pressure appears to be slowing, but the damage was done well before February's sharp leg lower.",

The project, requiring 1.2 gigawatts of continuous power and expected to generate 5,000 jobs, is a direct byproduct of the 50% tariff on steel, aluminum, and copper that survived the Supreme Court's broader tariff rollback in February. Whether this is industrial policy working or simply expensive reshoring math remains the open question.",

Section 1960 to explicitly exempt noncustodial software developers from federal money transmission law. The legislation is a direct response to the conviction of Tornado Cash co-founder Roman Storm in August 2025 and Samourai Wallet guilty pleas in November 2025, both of which sent a chill through DeFi development communities. The bill's bipartisan framing signals that developer liability has become a live political fault line, not just an industry grievance.",
