Trump has publicly floated a 'limited military strike' to force Tehran into a new nuclear deal, while Iran has warned of immediate retaliation and potential closure of the Strait of Hormuz, which handles 20-30% of global seaborne oil. Saudi spare capacity stands at roughly 2.4 million bpd, a buffer that would be tested severely in a full disruption scenario.",

Prosecutors have already asked a federal court to approve returning the assets to Bitfinex as in-kind restitution, and Trump's executive order explicitly carves out court-ordered dispositions. The distinction matters: a restitution transfer is not a sovereign sale, but markets counting every government-held coin as permanently strategic are building on contested ground.",

Xiaomi's Beijing plant produces a car every 76 seconds using 700 robots and AI-driven defect detection, while US manufacturers — especially smaller ones — are stuck with outdated equipment and manual data entry.
