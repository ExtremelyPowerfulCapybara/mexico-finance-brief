    "editor_note": "Fellow Humans, Europe's diplomatic traffic to Beijing is becoming something of a pilgrimage: Macron went, Starmer went, and now Merz has made the trip, business delegation in tow, to tell Xi Jinping that the €90 billion trade deficit is 'not healthy' while simultaneously cheering a 120-aircraft Airbus order. Meanwhile, Washington is quietly licensing Venezuelan oil resales to a Cuba it helped starve of fuel — the kind of policy whiplash that passes for strategy these days.",

        "body": "German Chancellor Friedrich Merz visited Beijing on Feb. 25 with a large business delegation, telling President Xi Jinping he wants to deepen the 'comprehensive strategic partnership' — even as Germany's trade deficit with China hit €90 billion last year, up fourfold since 2020. China announced a 120-aircraft Airbus order as a goodwill gesture, but Merz was blunt that the imbalance driven by Chinese overcapacity is 'not healthy.' The visit follows Macron and Starmer to Beijing and signals Europe's deliberate hedge against a deteriorating relationship with Washington.",

        "body": "The U.S. Treasury Department said it will authorise companies to apply for licences to resell Venezuelan oil to Cuba, reversing a supply cut that followed Washington's seizure of control over Venezuela's oil exports in January. Cuba lost its main crude supplier when the U.S. took over Venezuela's export flow, and Mexico — an interim substitute — also halted shipments in January. The move, timed to Secretary of State Marco Rubio's Caribbean visit, is conditional: transactions must support the Cuban private sector and cannot benefit Cuban military or government institutions.",

Murphy ruled Wednesday that the Trump administration's policy of deporting migrants to third countries with which they have no connection violates due process, finding that the policy 'extinguishes valid challenges by effecting removal before those challenges can be raised.' Murphy suspended his ruling for 15 days to allow a government appeal — the same case in which the Supreme Court's conservative majority previously paused his earlier decision, clearing a flight to South Sudan. The ruling adds fresh legal turbulence to an immigration enforcement agenda that already faces multiple active injunctions.",

Growth was driven overwhelmingly by non-oil taxes, which came in N3.4 trillion above projection, while oil tax revenues missed by 5.2%. The 2026 target assumes oil production rising from 1.7 to 1.8 million barrels per day and reflects structural reforms transferring petroleum royalties to NRS.",
