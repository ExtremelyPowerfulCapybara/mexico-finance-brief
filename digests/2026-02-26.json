        "body": "The Federal Reserve has quietly named Randall Guynn, a longtime Davis Polk & Wardwell financial institutions lawyer, as its next director of supervision and regulation, effective March 8. The appointment breaks a decades-long tradition of filling the role with career Fed staff — the last time an outsider held it was before 1977. Critics at Better Markets called it 'appointing a lifelong arsonist as fire chief,' warning the move will accelerate deregulatory policy favoring Guynn's former Wall Street clients.",

        "body": "Stablecoin issuer Circle reported fourth-quarter revenue up 77% year-over-year, sending shares up 23% in morning trading and offering a rare bright spot in a months-long crypto slump. USDC in circulation rose approximately 72% compared to a year earlier, reaching a market cap of around $75 billion, with Visa and Polymarket among major adopters. The beat underscores stablecoins' growing role as payment infrastructure even as broader crypto prices languish, though analysts at CFRA flagged rate compression and market share competition as key risks to sustaining the momentum.",

The JV, first flagged at RIL's August 2025 AGM, will build enterprise AI services leveraging Meta's open-source Llama models distributed across Reliance's vast digital infrastructure. The close arrives as the Nifty IT index has shed roughly 20% in February alone and questions mount over whether AI capital expenditure will ever generate commensurate returns.",

(NASDAQ: FRMI), alleging the company's IPO materials misrepresented demand for its 'Project Matador' AI data center campus. The complaint centres on a December 2025 disclosure that the project's anchor tenant terminated a $150 million Advance in Aid of Construction Agreement, which sent the stock down nearly 34% in a single session. The case is a pointed reminder that the AI infrastructure boom has minted at least as many liabilities as it has data centers.",

Luxury retailers are responding by leaning into value messaging, resale markets, and BNPL options, channels once considered beneath the demographic. Moody's Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi notes the spending gap between income cohorts 'has never been wider,' even as the top 10% of earners account for nearly half of all U.S. consumption.",

The disclosure adds a significant procedural dimension to what is already one of the most politically charged arrests in recent British history. Mandelson's detention is likely to reverberate through UK financial and political circles given his decades at the intersection of government, business, and transatlantic trade.",

Pope was in Mexico City during the explosions and spent Sunday advising guests to stay indoors, relying on filtered water stocks to keep them comfortable while grocery stores remained shuttered. The account illustrates the direct economic exposure of the short-term rental market to Mexico's security situation — a risk that formal balance sheets rarely capture in real time.",
