Meanwhile, the actual geopolitical news — Ukraine peace sequencing, Modi at the Knesset, cartels designated terrorists after El Mencho's death — is moving fast enough that the aliens story almost makes sense by comparison.",

Ukraine is simultaneously negotiating a 'prosperity package' covering reconstruction financing, with Kyiv targeting $800 billion in public and private funds over a decade. The territorial question remains the core impasse, with Moscow and Kyiv still far apart.",

Chip Roy is pressing House colleagues to pass the Drug Cartel Terrorist Designation Act, which would enshrine Trump's executive order into statute. Violence in Puerto Vallarta has killed over 70 people since the operation, and the US Embassy has issued shelter-in-place guidance for Americans in parts of Mexico. Roy's argument: executive orders can be reversed by the next administration; legislation cannot.",

Emails revealed Summers consulting Epstein on a personal relationship and using a racial slur in a separate exchange; Summers had previously called his association with Epstein 'a major error in judgement.' The resignation follows Nobel laureate Richard Axel's departure from Columbia, signaling that the Epstein document releases are still extracting institutional casualties.",

Kalshi has reported both cases to the CFTC and disclosed it has opened 200 insider trading investigations over the past year — a number that underscores how rapidly enforcement is scaling alongside the industry.",

The trades arrived days after any public alien-related news had subsided, with no congressional hearings or credible leaks circulating online at the time. Kalshi's own enforcement team is actively investigating insider trading across its platform, making this particular wager an uncomfortable data point.",

The visit deepens a defence-heavy bilateral relationship: India spent $20.5 billion on Israeli weapons between 2020 and 2024, and the two countries signed a bilateral investment treaty in September 2025. Modi's alignment carries weight given that Indian public opinion has grown increasingly critical of Israel's Gaza campaign, which has killed at least 72,000 people.",
