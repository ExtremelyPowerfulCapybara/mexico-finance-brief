Markets are choosing to look at the cheerful side of the ledger today, but the Middle East is doing its best to remind everyone that complacency has a cost.",

        "body": "Saudi crude shipments surged to 7.3 million barrels per day in the first 24 days of February 2026 — the highest since April 2023 — as Riyadh activates a contingency plan to offset supply disruptions if the US strikes Iran. Trump has publicly floated a 'limited military strike' to force Tehran into a new nuclear deal, while Iran has warned of immediate retaliation and potential closure of the Strait of Hormuz, which handles 20-30% of global seaborne oil. Saudi spare capacity stands at roughly 2.4 million bpd, a buffer that would be tested severely in a full disruption scenario.",

White House CEA acting chair Pierre Yared dismissed the paper as 'science fiction' that 'violates basic accounting in economics,' while Citadel Securities argued historical waves of technological change have not rendered labor obsolete. Nvidia reported earnings after the bell, providing the sector's next real test of sentiment.",

Havana subsequently alleged the occupants were armed Cuban-Americans attempting to 'infiltrate the island and unleash terrorism.' Secretary of State Marco Rubio, traveling in the Caribbean, said the US would not rely on Cuba's account and would 'respond accordingly' once facts are established — a geopolitical flashpoint arriving at a moment when the US is already strangling Cuba's fuel supply.",

The partial easing follows a near-total fuel blockade that has left Cuban hospitals cutting services and streets piling up with uncollected rubbish. The carve-out is narrow and the humanitarian situation on the island remains acute, with Canada separately pledging CAD $8 million in aid via the UN.",

        "body": "Of the roughly 328,372 BTC the US government controls — worth approximately $21.6 billion — some 94,643 BTC is tied to the 2016 Bitfinex hack and subject to potential court-ordered restitution, which would mechanically shrink the reserve to around 234,000 BTC. Prosecutors have already asked a federal court to approve returning the assets to Bitfinex as in-kind restitution, and Trump's executive order explicitly carves out court-ordered dispositions. The distinction matters: a restitution transfer is not a sovereign sale, but markets counting every government-held coin as permanently strategic are building on contested ground.",

Xiaomi's Beijing plant produces a car every 76 seconds using 700 robots and AI-driven defect detection, while US manufacturers — especially smaller ones — are stuck with outdated equipment and manual data entry. Nahm's prescription is blunt: Washington must shift focus from trade flows to factory-floor deployment.",

The move follows a more dovish-than-expected Reserve Bank of New Zealand OCR decision, which signaled a later and shallower tightening path than markets had priced, causing wholesale rates to ease. Westpac made comparable cuts last week; the back-and-forth on longer-term mortgage pricing reflects ongoing market uncertainty about the terminal rate path.",
