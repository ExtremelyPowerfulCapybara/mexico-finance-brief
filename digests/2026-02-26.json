Meanwhile, Washington is quietly licensing Venezuelan oil resales to a Cuba it helped starve of fuel — the kind of policy whiplash that passes for strategy these days.",

China announced a 120-aircraft Airbus order as a goodwill gesture, but Merz was blunt that the imbalance driven by Chinese overcapacity is 'not healthy.' The visit follows Macron and Starmer to Beijing and signals Europe's deliberate hedge against a deteriorating relationship with Washington.",

Cuba lost its main crude supplier when the U.S. took over Venezuela's export flow, and Mexico — an interim substitute — also halted shipments in January. The move, timed to Secretary of State Marco Rubio's Caribbean visit, is conditional: transactions must support the Cuban private sector and cannot benefit Cuban military or government institutions.",

Murphy ruled Wednesday that the Trump administration's policy of deporting migrants to third countries with which they have no connection violates due process, finding that the policy 'extinguishes valid challenges by effecting removal before those challenges can be raised.' Murphy suspended his ruling for 15 days to allow a government appeal — the same case in which the Supreme Court's conservative majority previously paused his earlier decision, clearing a flight to South Sudan. The ruling adds fresh legal turbulence to an immigration enforcement agenda that already faces multiple active injunctions.",

Growth was driven overwhelmingly by non-oil taxes, which came in N3.4 trillion above projection, while oil tax revenues missed by 5.2%.
