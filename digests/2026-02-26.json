    "editor_note": "Fellow Humans, Jensen Huang just handed AI skeptics another uncomfortable data point: $68 billion in quarterly revenue, 73% year-over-year growth, and a $78 billion forward guide that makes the 'AI bubble' narrative look increasingly strained. Meanwhile, Ukraine peace talks are inching toward a leaders-level meeting, cartel violence in Mexico is escalating in the wake of El Mencho's death, and the Supreme Court has put a leash — however temporary — on Trump's tariff ambitions.",

        "body": "Nvidia reported Q4 fiscal 2026 revenue of $68.1 billion, beating guidance by roughly $3 billion and up 73% year-over-year, with GAAP gross margins recovering to 75%. CEO Jensen Huang brushed off AI bubble concerns on the earnings call, arguing that in the new economy 'compute is revenues' — without tokens, cloud providers cannot grow. The company guided Q1 fiscal 2027 revenue to $78 billion and said it has strategically secured supply commitments totaling $95.2 billion, up from $50.3 billion last quarter.",

The agenda covers a post-war recovery plan, a potential prisoner swap, and groundwork for a trilateral meeting with Russian officials expected in early March. Zelenskyy said a leaders-level summit is 'the only way to resolve all the complex and sensitive issues,' though Moscow and Kyiv remain deadlocked on territory, with the World Bank pegging Ukraine's reconstruction cost at $588 billion.",

Trump responded by immediately enacting a 10% worldwide tariff under Section 122 of the 1974 Trade Act, demonstrating that the ruling is a constraint, not a ceiling. The decision is symbolically significant as a check on executive overreach but offers trading partners only partial relief.",

The FDA had approved the drug for smallpox based on animal models, but STOMP is the first rigorous human trial for mpox. The findings, ACTG Chair Joseph Eron said, underscore the critical importance of randomized controlled trials and highlight the absence of proven therapeutics for mpox, which remains a global health concern.",
