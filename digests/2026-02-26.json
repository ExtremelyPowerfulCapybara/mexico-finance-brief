    "editor_note": "Fellow Humans, the Federal Reserve has quietly handed bank supervision to a man who spent four decades representing the banks he'll now police — and the market, characteristically, has other things to worry about. Circle's stablecoin revenue is up 77%, Reliance and Meta are formalizing their AI joint venture, and somewhere in Albuquerque a streamer is planning to put pizza on a roof. We cover what matters.",

        "body": "The Federal Reserve board has named Randall Guynn — a nearly 40-year veteran of Davis Polk & Wardwell's Financial Institutions Group — as director of supervision and regulation, effective March 8. The appointment breaks a tradition dating to at least 1977 of filling the role with career Fed staff. Critics, including Better Markets CEO Dennis Kelleher, have described the move as regulatory capture in plain sight, arguing that Guynn's entire professional history was spent representing the very institutions he will now oversee.",

The case adds to growing scrutiny over AI infrastructure companies that raised capital on bullish demand projections.",
