Meanwhile, Circle just posted 77% revenue growth on stablecoin demand, proving that somewhere in this muddled macro picture, someone is making money — just not necessarily in the places the last cycle trained us to look.",

        "body": "Canada's second-largest pension fund reported C$517 billion in net assets after a 9.3% return in 2025, trailing its 10.9% benchmark — dragged by private equity gains of just 2.3% and US dollar depreciation. CEO Charles Emond warned that AI concentration risk may represent up to 20% of S&P 500 pricing and said policy instability could erode global appetite for American assets. The fund is actively reducing equity exposure and rotating toward credit.",

Brands are responding by emphasizing value narratives and payment flexibility including BNPL, as 28% of high-income shoppers report trading down on quality.
