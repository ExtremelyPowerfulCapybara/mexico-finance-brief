Trump responded by threatening to impose a 15% global tariff, escalating the standoff. The ruling injects significant instability into global supply chains and currency markets at a moment when trade relationships are already strained.",

Cuba produces only 40% of its required fuel, and Air Canada has already suspended flights due to aviation fuel shortages. Mexico previously sent two Navy ships with roughly 2,300 tons of humanitarian goods; Canada is now following suit, putting both countries in direct friction with Washington's embargo posture.",

Elizabeth Warren that the administration has held meetings with finance executives about selling all or part of the $1.7 trillion federal student loan portfolio. The department stopped short of announcing any final decision, but this marks the first official public acknowledgment of the discussions first reported by Politico in October. Private lenders are already positioning for an influx of borrowers, raising serious questions about which income-driven repayment protections would survive a transfer to private hands.",
