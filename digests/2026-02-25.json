Goolsbee is pumping the brakes on rate cuts, consumers are barely off the mat after January's confidence collapse, and Russia's war economy is being cited as a slow-motion structural implosion. The Fed patience trade is back, and markets are pricing in discomfort. — Ed.",

        "body": "Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said Tuesday he wants to see further inflation progress before supporting additional rate cuts, adding that a recent tariff court ruling could help ease price pressures. The comment reinforces the Fed's wait-and-see posture heading into spring, with markets already pushing back rate-cut expectations. For rate-sensitive assets, this is another reminder that the easing cycle is not on autopilot.",

However, the expectations sub-index — a recession leading indicator — rose only to 72, still well below the critical 80 threshold for the 13th consecutive month. Trade and politics are top of mind for respondents, while the labor market added just 584,000 jobs in all of 2025, roughly one-quarter of 2024's pace.",

Elevated military spending is crowding out investment, labor shortages are deepening, and inflation is running hot. The longer the war continues, the steeper the eventual economic unwind.",

Gross margins are estimated to have declined 130–225 basis points sequentially as spot freight rates surged faster than RXO could reprice contracts, with EBITDA falling well short of management's $20–30 million guidance. Accounting opacity — including the abrupt departure of the Chief Accounting Officer — adds another layer of concern to an already fragile balance sheet.",

Physical cash withdrawals surged to ₹4.4 trillion in the 14 months to January 2026 — three times the prior year's pace — and RBI dollar-selling operations are permanently removing rupee liquidity.
