canada's foreign minister anita anand confirmed monday that ottawa is preparing an aid package for cuba, which is facing severe blackouts and fuel shortages after the u.s. oil embargo cut off venezuelan and mexican supply. cuba produces only 40% of its required fuel, and air canada has already suspended flights due to aviation fuel shortages. mexico previously sent two navy ships with roughly 2,300 tons of humanitarian goods; canada is now following suit, putting both countries in direct friction with washington's embargo posture. yahoo finance / ap energy trump administration confirms $1.7 trillion federal student loan portfolio sale is under active consideration the department of education's undersecretary nicholas kent confirmed in a letter to sen. elizabeth warren that the administration has held meetings with finance executives about selling all or part of the $1.7 trillion federal student loan portfolio. the department stopped short of announcing any final decision, but this marks the first official public acknowledgment of the discussions first reported by politico in october. private lenders are already positioning for an influx of borrowers, raising serious questions about which income-driven repayment protections would survive a transfer to private hands. business insider politics crypto slides hard: btc down 4%, sol down 6%, solana company shares fall 13% bitcoin dropped more than 4% and solana fell nearly 6% in a 24-hour period, dragging listed crypto infrastructure plays down sharply \u2014 solana company (hsdt) shed 13.3% to $1.76. the broader drawdown comes as solana company announced its 'pacific backbone' buildout connecting seoul, tokyo, singapore, and hong kong to support institutional staking and trading on the solana network. building high-speed infrastructure into a falling market is a bold call; the $180 million sol treasury makes the timing uncomfortable. coindesk markets supreme court tariff ruling creates strategic uncertainty for india's export sector india's economic times flags that the u.s. supreme court's tariff ruling introduces fresh instability for indian exporters who had been navigating trump-era levies. the ruling forces a recalibration of what trade exposure actually looks like for emerging market economies that had been factoring in a specific tariff regime. the follow-on threat of a 15% global tariff compounds the uncertainty for policymakers in new delhi. the economic times trade spacex launches official starlink retail sales in venezuela, adds demand surcharge starting

insurance segment cartel violence triggered by the killing of jalisco new generation cartel leader 'el mencho' disrupted puerto vallarta and guadalajara airports over the weekend, rattling a tourism sector that accounts for roughly 10% of mexico's gdp. am best, which already holds a negative outlook on mexico's insurance segment, warns that continued unrest compounds existing headwinds including

fourth day iranian government spokesperson fatemeh mohajerani acknowledged students 'have wounds in their hearts' following thousands of killings during january protests, but warned that burning the

escalating us-cuba tensions cuba's interior ministry confirmed its coast guard shot dead four people and wounded six aboard a florida-registered speedboat one nautical mile from its northern coast, claiming the vessel fired first. havana subsequently alleged the occupants were armed cuban-americans attempting to 'infiltrate the island and unleash terrorism.' secretary of state marco rubio, traveling in the caribbean, said the us would not rely on cuba's account and would 'respond accordingly' once facts are established \u2014 a geopolitical flashpoint arriving at a moment when the us is already strangling cuba's fuel supply. dw (english) politics us greenlights resale of venezuelan oil to cuba's private sector the us treasury's ofac announced it would adopt a favorable licensing policy for resale of venezuelan-origin oil to cuba, provided transactions benefit the cuban private sector rather than the government, military, or intelligence services. the partial easing follows a near-total fuel blockade that has left cuban hospitals cutting services and streets piling up with uncollected rubbish. the carve-out is narrow and the humanitarian situation on the island remains acute, with canada separately pledging cad $8 million in aid via the un. dw (english) politics us strategic bitcoin reserve may be 30% smaller than advertised due to bitfinex litigation of the roughly

mechanically shrink the reserve to around 234,000 btc. prosecutors have already asked a federal court to approve returning the assets to bitfinex as in-kind restitution, and trump's executive order explicitly carves out court-ordered dispositions. the distinction matters: a restitution transfer is not a sovereign sale, but markets counting every government-held coin as permanently strategic are building on contested ground. cryptoslate markets op-ed: china deploys ai in factories while america debates it in conference rooms former white house economist jonas nahm argues in the nyt that the us-china ai gap is a manufacturing execution problem, not just an r&d competition: tesla's shanghai factory dramatically outperforms its california counterpart on output per worker, and china has over 30,000 'smart factories' already operational. xiaomi's beijing plant produces a car every 76 seconds using 700 robots and ai-driven defect detection, while us manufacturers \u2014 especially smaller ones \u2014 are stuck with outdated equipment and manual data entry. nahm's prescription is blunt: washington must shift focus from trade flows to factory-floor deployment. newser / new york times
