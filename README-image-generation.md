# Editorial Image Generation — README

A self-contained subsystem for **The Opening Bell** newsletter that generates editorial images
with automatic deduplication across issues, using perceptual hashing and prompt similarity.

---

## Overview

The system prevents repeated images by:
1. **Concept tagging** — each image is tagged with a visual metaphor label (e.g. `industrial_cluster`). Overused tags are detected and avoided in novelty directives.
2. **Two-phase image similarity** — phash compared against recent same-category images (last 15) then all recent global images (last 50). Only image similarity triggers rejection.
3. **Text monitoring** — TF-IDF cosine similarity flags risky prompts but does not reject on its own. The `accepted_prompt` (revised_prompt when available) is always used for comparison.
4. **Automatic escalation** — levels 0–3. Level 0 = minor tweak; level 3 = full conceptual shift. Escalation advances on each failed attempt.
5. **Attempt tracking** — every API call is logged in `generation_attempts` with accepted/rejected status and rejection reason.

## Setup

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

New packages required: `imagehash`, `scikit-learn` (added to `requirements.txt`).

Set your OpenAI API key:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

Or create a `bot/.env` file and it will be loaded automatically by the CLI.

## Concept Tags

Each generated image is assigned a **concept tag** — a short visual metaphor label that identifies what type of scene was depicted. Examples:

| Category | Concept tag | Subject keywords |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| energy | `industrial_cluster` | refinery, tower, chimney, flare |
| energy | `pipeline_infrastructure` | pipeline, valve, pipe |
| energy | `offshore_platform` | offshore, platform, rig |
| shipping_geopolitics | `container_logistics` | container, crane |
| shipping_geopolitics | `port_infrastructure` | port, harbor, dock |
| trade_supply_chain | `restriction_barrier` | checkpoint, barrier, gate, customs |
| macro_inflation | `institutional_facade` | bank, central, column, inscription |
| markets_finance | `financial_atrium` | atrium, tower |

Concept tags are inferred automatically from `main_subject` via keyword matching. Use `--concept-tag` to override.

When the same concept tag appears 3 or more times in recent category history, the novelty directive at escalation level 2+ explicitly names the overused tags to avoid.

## Variation Codes

Format: `[COMPOSITION]-[FOREGROUND]-[BACKGROUND]-[COLOR]`

Example: `B-2-ii-gamma`

| Component | Keys | Examples |
|-----------|------|---------|
| Composition | A–E | A=centered, B=left-weighted, C=right-weighted, D=diagonal, E=split-frame |
| Foreground | 1–4 | 1=single subject, 2=dual tension, 3=scattered, 4=frame-within-frame |
| Background | i–iv | i=minimal, ii=moderate, iii=rich, iv=complex |
| Color | alpha–epsilon | alpha=warm earth, beta=cool slate, gamma=monochrome, delta=sepia, epsilon=single accent |

---

## Escalation Levels

| Level | Trigger | Directive |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| 0 | First attempt (optional) | Minor framing/placement variation |
| 1 | First retry (phash rejected) | Different foreground subject and spatial relationship |
| 2 | Second retry | New environmental setting, different metaphor; concept-aware |
| 3 | Third retry | Full conceptual shift — new subject, opposite balance, new environment |

---

## Database Schema

Two SQLite tables in `data/image_history.db`:

**`image_history`** — one row per accepted generation:
`id`, `created_at`, `issue_date`, `story_slug`, `category`, `prompt_master_version`, `prompt_sent`, `revised_prompt`, `accepted_prompt`, `variation_code`, `novelty_request`, `concept_tag`, `image_path`, `image_phash`, `similarity_score_text`, `similarity_score_image`, `regeneration_count`, `notes`

**`generation_attempts`** — one row per API call (including rejected):
`id`, `parent_image_id`, `created_at`, `prompt_sent`, `revised_prompt`, `accepted`, `rejection_reason`, `image_phash`, `similarity_score_text`, `similarity_score_image`

---

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Required for generation |
| `OPENAI_IMAGE_MODEL` | Default: `gpt-image-1` |
| `OPENAI_IMAGE_SIZE` | Default: `1024x1024` |

## How the registry prevents repeated category images

The `config/image_prompt_registry.yaml` file stores per-category building blocks: a list of
`allowed_concepts`, `allowed_subject_families`, and `allowed_compositions`. Each category has
4-5 entries per list, giving 64-125 unique `(concept_tag, subject_family, composition_preset)`
triples before any repeat is necessary.

**Selection flow:**

1. `select_prompt_components()` (in `lib/image_registry.py`) loads the registry and fetches the
   last 8 same-category history records.
2. Every candidate triple in the cross-product of the allowed pools is scored by how many times
   it appears in the recent 8. Lower count = better.
3. Tiebreak: prefer triples where 2+ dimensions differ from the most recent image's triple.
4. The lowest-penalty triple is selected; ties are broken randomly.

**Retry rotation:**

Each rejected attempt adds its triple to `excluded_combos`. On the next attempt,
`select_prompt_components()` is called again with the updated exclusion list, ensuring:

- Retry 1: different `composition_preset` preferred
- Retry 2: different `subject_family` preferred
- Retry 3: different `concept_tag` if needed

**Auto-novelty:**

If any `subject_family` or `composition_preset` appears 3+ times in the last 8 same-category
records, a novelty directive is automatically generated naming what to avoid. This is injected at
attempt 0 when no manual `--novelty-request` is provided.

---

## How `accepted_prompt`, `concept_tag`, `subject_family`, and `composition_preset` work together

Every accepted generation stores four semantic fields in `image_history`:

| Field | What it stores | Used for |
|-------|----------------|----------|
| `accepted_prompt` | `revised_prompt` if the model rewrote the prompt, else `prompt_sent` | Text similarity comparison - always the prompt the model *actually used* |
| `concept_tag` | Visual metaphor label inferred or overridden at generation time (e.g. `maritime_passage`) | Concept-frequency tracking for novelty directives |
| `subject_family` | Registry subject family chosen at generation time (e.g. `tanker`) | Anti-repetition scoring across same-category runs |
| `composition_preset` | Registry composition preset chosen at generation time (e.g. `elevated_wide`) | Anti-repetition scoring across same-category runs |

Using `accepted_prompt` for text similarity (rather than `prompt_sent`) ensures that if the image
model rewrites the prompt - which OpenAI models frequently do - similarity comparisons are made
against the version that actually influenced the image.

The three semantic fields together define the combination space. By tracking them across issues,
`select_prompt_components()` can avoid repeating not just the same words in a prompt, but the same
*visual concept*, *subject category*, and *framing approach* - the three dimensions most responsible
for images looking identical.
